### Multistage Example

#### Java REST Service

```
##### Stage 1 - Lets build the "deployable package"
FROM maven:3.6.1-jdk-8-alpine as backend-build
WORKDIR /fullstack/backend

### Step 1 - Copy pom.xml and download project dependencies

# Dividing copy into two steps to ensure that we download dependencies 
# only when pom.xml changes
COPY pom.xml .
# dependency:go-offline - Goal that resolves all project dependencies, 
# including plugins and reports and their dependencies. -B -> Batch mode
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline -B

### Step 2 - Copy source and build "deployable package"
COPY src src
RUN mvn install -DskipTests

# Unzip
RUN mkdir -p target/dependency && (cd target/dependency; jar -xf ../*.jar)

##### Stage 2 - Let's build a minimal image with the "deployable package"
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
VOLUME /tmp
ARG DEPENDENCY=/fullstack/backend/target/dependency
COPY --from=backend-build ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/lib /app/lib
COPY --from=backend-build ${DEPENDENCY}/META-INF /app/META-INF
COPY --from=backend-build ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/classes /app
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-cp","app:app/lib/*","com.in28minutes.rest.webservices.restfulwebservices.RestfulWebServicesApplication"]
```

#### React Front End

```
## Stage 1 - Lets build the "deployable package"
FROM node:7.10 as frontend-build
WORKDIR /fullstack/frontend

# Step 1 - Download all package dependencies first.
# We will redownload dependencies only when packages change.
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

# Step 2 - Copy all source and run build
COPY . ./
RUN npm run build

## Stage 2 - Let's build a minimal image with the "deployable package"
FROM nginx:1.12-alpine
COPY --from=frontend-build /fullstack/frontend/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
